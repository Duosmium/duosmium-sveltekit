# Duosmium Results Frontend

This repository contains the codebase for the frontend of the next version of [Duosmium Results](https://www.duosmium.org), written using SvelteKit, Supabase, Tailwind, and shadcn-svelte. The backend is available at <https://github.com/Duosmium/duosmium-express>.

This website is a work in progress and does not contain every feature of the standard website.
It likely will not have up-to-date results either. Do not rely on it for anything important.

If you spot any bugs or have any feedback, email [duosmium@gmail.com](mailto:duosmium@gmail.com).
